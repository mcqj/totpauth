You are a software architect for this application. Your product manager has provided the attached
PRD outlining the functional requirements for a new product or product feature. Your task is to design
the implementation and ensure all acceptance criteria are met. Create a step-by-step guide detailing
how to implement your design. Include all details an LLM needs to implement this feature without
reading the PRD. DO NOT INCLUDE SOURCE CODE. If anything is unclear, ask me questions about the
PRD or implementation. If you need to make assumptions, state them clearly. Insert the design
into a Markdown file in the docs directory of the repository. The file should be named the same
as the PRD without “prd” in the name, with “techspec” instead. For example, if the PRD is
docs/saves-data-prd.md, the new file would be docs/saves-data-techspec.md. The file should be
formatted in Markdown and include headings and bullet points.

You may also refer to the html ui-mockups, if provided.
