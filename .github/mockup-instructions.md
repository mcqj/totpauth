# UI Mockup Instructions

To ensure consistency and high quality in our UI design process, please follow these guidelines when creating mockups for our product.

## General Guidelines

- **Format:** Each screen mockup must be delivered as a single file containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Technologies:** Use only standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Do not use frameworks or libraries (e.g., React, Vue, Bootstrap, Tailwind, jQuery).
- **Self-Contained:** All styles and scripts must be included within the file (no external dependencies or CDN links).
- **Responsiveness:** Design mockups to be responsive and mobile-first, reflecting the look and feel of a modern mobile app.
- **Clarity:** Use clear, semantic HTML structure and meaningful class or id names.
- **Accessibility:** Follow accessibility best practices (e.g., proper labels, contrast, keyboard navigation).
- **Consistency:** Use consistent spacing, colors, typography, and component styles across all screens.
- **Interactivity:** Include basic JavaScript to demonstrate interactive elements (e.g., button states, modal open/close, form validation).
- **Annotations:** Add comments in the code to explain key design decisions or interactive behaviors.

## File Naming

- Name each file according to the screen or feature it represents, using kebab-case (e.g., `login-screen.html`, `settings-modal.html`).

## Deliverables

- For each screen, provide a single `.html` file containing all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Place all mockup files in a single folder or zip archive for delivery.

## Example File Structure

```html
<!-- login-screen.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Login Screen Mockup</title>
  <style>
    /* CSS styles here */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- HTML markup here -->
  <script>
    // JavaScript interactivity here
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```
