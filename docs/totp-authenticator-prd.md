# TOTP Authenticator App - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Document Overview
- **Title:** TOTP Authenticator App
- **Author(s):** Product Team
- **Date:** 2025-07-02 (Created & Last Updated)
- **Status:** Draft

## 2. Objective
- **Problem Statement:**
  - Users need a secure and convenient way to generate Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) for logging into applications that require 2-factor authentication (2FA).
- **Goals & Success Metrics:**
  - Enable users to add and manage multiple TOTP credentials.
  - Allow users to scan QR codes to add new credentials easily.
  - Generate and display valid TOTP codes for each credential.
  - Success measured by: number of credentials added, successful logins using generated codes, user retention, and positive user feedback.

## 3. Background & Context
- **Business Context:**
  - 2FA adoption is increasing for security. A user-friendly TOTP app supports secure access and aligns with security-focused company goals.
- **User Personas:**
  - Security-conscious individuals
  - IT professionals
  - General users of 2FA-enabled applications
- **Stakeholders:**
  - Product Manager (requirements, prioritization)
  - Engineering Team (implementation)
  - Design Team (UX/UI)
  - QA Team (testing)

## 4. Requirements
- **User Stories:**
  - As a user, I want to add a new application by scanning a QR code so that I can quickly set up TOTP for that app.
  - As a user, I want to view a list of all my added applications and their current TOTP codes so that I can use them for login.
  - As a user, I want to delete credentials I no longer need so that I can keep my list organized.
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - Add new TOTP credential via QR code scan (using device camera)
  - Display list of added credentials with app name and current TOTP code
  - Delete credentials
  - Generate TOTP codes according to RFC 6238
  - Securely store credentials on device
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - App must not store secrets in plain text
  - Fast code generation (<1s)
  - Support for iOS and Android (Expo-managed)
  - Accessibility support (screen readers, color contrast)
- **Out of Scope:**
  - Cloud sync or backup
  - Push notifications
  - Web version

## 5. User Experience
- **User Flows:**
  1. User opens app → taps “Add Application” → camera opens → scans QR code → credential added → TOTP code displayed
  2. User views list of credentials → selects one to view code
  3. User deletes a credential
- **Wireframes/Mockups:**
  - To be provided by Design Team
- **Accessibility Considerations:**
  - All screens navigable by screen reader
  - Sufficient color contrast
  - Large tap targets

## 6. Technical Considerations
- **Dependencies:**
  - Expo Camera API
  - TOTP generation library (RFC 6238 compliant)
  - Secure storage (Expo SecureStore)
- **Assumptions:**
  - Users will have a device with a camera
  - QR codes follow standard TOTP URI format
- **Risks & Mitigations:**
  - Risk: Camera permissions denied → Mitigation: Provide manual entry fallback
  - Risk: Device loss → Mitigation: Warn users to back up secrets externally

## 7. Analytics & Tracking
- **KPIs & Metrics:**
  - Number of credentials added
  - Frequency of TOTP code generation
  - App retention rate
- **Event Tracking:**
  - Credential added
  - Credential deleted
  - QR code scanned

## 8. Rollout & Launch Plan
- **Release Phases:**
  - Beta (internal testing)
  - General Availability (public release)
- **Communication Plan:**
  - Announce via company blog, app store updates
  - Notify stakeholders via email/slack
- **Support & Training:**
  - In-app help section
  - FAQ in documentation
